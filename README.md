# Zero-Shot-Object-Detection-Segmentation
DIH Project

#### Created Model for training
Model completed.

#### Processed Annotation Files for seen and unseen classes

### Need to read implementation details from the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04340.pdf.
### Found Edge Box implementation in OpenCV
### Need to extract features for unseen ground truth objects and generate their targets (labels/string) for evaluation.
### Need to understand and implement Recall@K for evaluation of model.
