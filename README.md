# Zero-Shot-Object-Detection-Segmentation
DIH Project

## Created Model for training
Model completed.

## Processed Annotation Files for seen and unseen classes

## Feature Extraction took 8 hours for MSCOCO (6 lakh objects).
## And 12 hours for VG (10 lakh objects).

## Need to read implementation details from the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04340.pdf.
## Need to work on Edge Boxes
## Need to work on Non-max suppression to reduce no. of background boxes
## Need to filtering of ground truth boxes which have a size of nearly 224x224 or greater than that.
## Need to extract features for unseen ground truth objects and generate their targets (labels/string) for evaluation.
## Need to understand and implement Recall@K for evaluation of model.
